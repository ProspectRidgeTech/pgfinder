#+TITLE: PGFinder : OpenSource Software for Peptidoglycan Analysis
#+AUTHOR: Neil Shephard
#+EMAIL: n.shephard@sheffield.ac.uk

* Why Care About Peptidoglycans?
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (roll-in) :frag-idx (5 4 3 2 1)
+ Molecules in membrane of Gram+ve bacteria.
+ Mediate exchange of DNA between cells (evolution).
+ Response to anti-bacterial drugs.
+ Therefore key to understanding...
  + Antimicrobial Resistance (e.g. MRSA).
  + Host-pathogen interactions.

+ Model and determine structure of molecules based on experimental data.
+ Traditionally done by "hand" in Excel.
+ Slow and time consuming as well as error prone.
+ PGFinder automates this process, improving accuracy and speed.
